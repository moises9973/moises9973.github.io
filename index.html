    <h1>Hollow Knight Silksong</h1>
    <p>
        Hollow Knight Silksong is a game by <strong>Team Cherry</strong> that just released last week and I have been having a lot of <strong>fun</strong>. It is a 2D platformer with a focus on <strong>boss fights</strong>. 
        Even though it is 2D, exploring the map is still fun, and the combat is also fun because of how cool the <strong>movement</strong> is. 
        It is really <strong>hard</strong>, but that makes it more fun. Its good to finally play this game after waiting <strong>7 years</strong> after it was announced.
